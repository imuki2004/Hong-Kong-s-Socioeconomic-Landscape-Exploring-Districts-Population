# Hong-Kong-s-Socioeconomic-Landscape-Exploring-Districts-Population
In this data visualization project, me and my fellows focused on exploring Hong Kong's socioeconomic landscape by analyzing the population distribution across different districts. We utilized Tableau for data visualization and Excel for data preprocessing and cleaning to gain meaningful insights into the demographics and socioeconomic characteristics of each district.

# Challenges:

Data Collection: Acquiring accurate and up-to-date data on population demographics for each district in Hong Kong posed a challenge. We had to ensure the reliability and consistency of the data sources to obtain accurate results. Unfortunatelly, only data from 2011 and 2016 were available. Datasets were taken from the Hong Kong Geodata store.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The initial dataset required extensive cleaning in Excel to handle missing values, inconsistent formats, and other data quality issues. I applied techniques such as deleting missing values, removing duplicate records, and standardizing variables to ensure data integrity.

Combining Data Sources: To enrich the analysis, I needed to integrate data from various sources, such as population statistics, educational institutions, etc. Merging these diverse datasets and aligning them properly required careful data integration techniques and handling potential discrepancies.

# Techniques:

Geospatial Visualization: Leveraging Tableau's mapping capabilities, I created visually compelling geospatial visualizations to represent the population distribution and educational institutions across different districts. By mapping the data onto the actual geography of Hong Kong, I provided an intuitive and interactive way for viewers to explore the socioeconomic landscape.

Visual Storytelling: I created a story using Tableau's abilitites merging together different interactive dashboards and sheets. Users easilty navigate through the story looking for specific districts, explore different variables, and uncover patterns and relationships within the data. This enhanced the user experience and made the project more engaging and informative.

# Limitations:

Data Granularity: The availability of detailed data at a more granular level, such as sub-districts or smaller administrative units, could have provided more nuanced insights. Due to data limitations, the analysis was constrained to district-level observations, which may have obscured some localized patterns or variations.

Data Updates: As the socioeconomic landscape of Hong Kong evolves over time, the dataset used for the project might become outdated. It is essential to regularly update the data to maintain the accuracy and relevance of the analysis.

Data Availability: Depending on the specific socioeconomic variables of interest, some data may not be readily available or accessible. This limitation might have impacted the comprehensiveness of the analysis or required alternative data sources or estimation methods.
